🚀 Project Context
GatherGrid is a platform that empowers users to create, promote, manage, and participate in events. This dynamic platform provides event organizers with an intuitive way to plan and promote events, while participants can seamlessly search, register, and engage with various event types.

🏢 Our Enterprise's Vision

Our enterprise is committed to modernizing this application by transitioning to a Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) architecture. The primary objective of this project is to configure the development environment and define a robust JEE architecture that will serve as the cornerstone for this migration.

🌐 Developer's Mission
As a web developer, your mission is two-fold:

Environment Evaluation & Setup:

🧐 Evaluate the requirements for the development environment (IDE, application server, database, etc.) for the JEE project.
⚙️ Install and meticulously configure the development environment on developers' machines.
🏗️ Architect a robust JEE framework that caters to the needs of the existing application.
📁 Establish a modular and well-organized project structure to simplify code management.
Class Diagram Introduction:

📊 Create and introduce a preliminary class diagram to visualize the project's structure and components.
🧩 UML Classes
Here are some pivotal UML classes essential for bringing the GatherGrid project to life:

User: Attributes include id, username, password, first name, last name, email, and more.
Event: Key attributes comprise id, name, date, time, location, description, category, organizer, and more.
Ticket: Significant attributes encompass id, price, quantity available, ticket type, and more.
Comment: Noteworthy attributes involve id, comment text, rating, user, event, and more.
Event Category: Prominent attributes consist of id, name, description, and more.
🛠️ Required Technologies
Select and leverage appropriate JEE technologies to fortify the project:

🧰 Maven: For efficient project management.
☕ Jakarta EE: Empowering enterprise-level solutions.
💼 Hibernate: For robust data persistence.
📦 JPA: Simplifying database interaction.
🌐 Servlets & JSP: Handling web interactions effectively.
... and more, tailored to the project's unique demands.
